# Auto Action Preview

## What is this

This is a Blender plugin that automatically set the scene's preview frame range to match current Action. It is designed to make previewing loop animations more convenient (especially for game animators).

## How to install

Download this repo as a zip file and install it in Blender preferences.

## How to use

Once the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a new checkbox called "Preview Range: Match Action" in the **Playback** menu on your timeline panel. It should be enabled by default.

Then when you enable **preview range** (by clicking the clock button next to the timeline's frame range setting), it will match the length of whichever action you select on the active object. (You may not see the preview range change immediately, which is intended behavior to prevent bugs. But once you start animation playback it should work automatically)
